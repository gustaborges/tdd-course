# Week 4

This project aims to store "points" of a user. Please note that this solution doesn't provide the registration of the user, but supposes that they are already registered. 

I chose to store their pontuations in a XML file which kind of works like a database.

I made use of specialized classes in Java that perform read and write operations in XML files.

All functionalities were developed using test-driven development approach.
