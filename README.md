# TDD Course - My solutions

This repository contains my project solutions for a test-driven development course I recently accomplished. Each week folder represents completely independent projects.

In each of them, you can find both the classes and their unit tests.

Understanding their intentios can be quite nebulous since the solutions are completely out of context, but I hope the codes are clear and of easy readability.
